# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering addresses the practical design, development, testing, and maintenance of software application


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software developemnt lifecycle emcopasses the Planning, Designing, Implementing, deployment and Mainatenance stage. Team are able to put their plans on coding, resource allocation, and time phrame in perspective. Deisgn choice is made, and executed before proceeding to Implementation. AT implementation stage, the build environemnt and production are separated to aid effective deploymnet and maintainance, as well as a balaned response to user's request. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall allows for a sequntial flow of work where the completion of phase directly leads to the start of the following phase, without deviation. Agile however allows for small incremental changes in each stage of design 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer writes the code for an application. Quality Assurance Enginer ensures that the required standard is met, and all errors are corrected. The Project Manager ensures that each sub-team delivers according to specification and timeline for end user's benefit.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Version Control System helps to track all changes made o a design in a special record file. This enables the developer or vetting engineer to control the correction process and access reasons for errors, if any. Integrated Development ENvironment refers to a software tool that holds compiler, editor, linker and operating system as an integrated pack fpr immediate use in software development.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid change in technology advancement/development. Engineers are encouraged to keep learining and up to date for efficiency. Limited time and infrastructure for project development. This may be sourced from other networks, or alternative lines created. Cmmunication with commissioning agnets, and project managers would help. Constant change in client's requirements inhibits effective tracing and validation mechanism

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
